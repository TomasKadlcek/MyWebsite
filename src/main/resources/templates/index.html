                <h2><b>Why I decided to code</b></h2>
                <p>My name is Tomas, I'm a self-taught programmer from Nivnice. Currently I live in Brno.</p>
                <p>I decided to study programming languages around the year 2019 because I always enjoyed working with
                    technologies and solving all kind of problems.
                    For my first language I choose <b>Python</b>. Soon enough I figured out programming might be the
                    field I would enjoy working in.
                    From learning new technologies to solving one problem after another I felt fulfilled but also hungry
                    for more.</p>
                <p>Aside from programming I always loved to travel. During the 4 years I lived in England I made a plan
                    to save some money
                    and head abroad for a <b>gap year</b>. The plan was to go around the world and learn some programming on
                    the way. Unluckily for me a pandemic came!
                    Just at the time I was leaving Britain. Even during the pandemic I managed several months of
                    traveling around Europe. And this brings me to Java.</p>
                <p>As soon as I finished my travels I wanted to learn a new language. And here <b>Java</b> came. I also
                    decided to focus more on my coding habits,
                    structure, testing etc. Each day I try to learn a new thing and improve on my skill set. With each
                    new knowledge or technology I feel there is still so much
                    to learn and this is what drives me to improve myself and give myself even bigger challenges.</p>

                <h2><b>Long story short...</b></h2>
                <p>For those who want to know why a truck driver wants to become a professional programmer...</p>
                <p>I love <b>challenges</b>!! Since I left middle school my life was full of them. Some of them were fun,
                    some of them less so. But all in all I do not regret any of my decisions.
                    I studied <b>Economics and Management in English</b> on UTB in Zlín. Unfortunately I did not like my
                    field of study and I craved something more from my life.
                    What university gave me was my newly found love of sports, I started <b>running, Boxing, Taekwondo,
                    self defence</b> and many other but all in all I felt my life was not going
                    the way I wanted so I decided to quit. Probably not my wisest decision but one of the most
                    impactful.</p>
                <p>In the coming months after I left university I decided its time to be more independent. I saved
                    some money and moved to <b>England</b>. For my first 18 months
                    I was very lucky and climbed the company ladder. I managed to get hired by a housing and work
                    agency and did for them various roles, the last of them being
                    contracted as an agency staff manager for one of their clients. Having directly under my lead
                    around 20 agency workers
                    and indirectly managing around 60 employees on the clients side.</p>
                <p>Already at that time I knew I wanted to save more money and go <b>travel</b>, after making some simple
                    counting I figured I need some change. And so came the idea of being a <b>truck driver</b>.
                    I made my licence and for the next 3 years I saved money and enjoyed my life as a Truck driver.
                    I knew from start truck driving is not the job for my whole life.
                    And there was born the idea to combine travelling with learning some new skill to start up a new
                    career after I finish my travels. I played with the idea of being
                    a translator, maybe sell stuff on amazon, buy some properties, go into finance etc.</p>
                <p>In the end I figured out I have to do something I enjoy and can see myself doing for the next
                    decade and longer. I always loved computers!!
                    Since primary school I was the kid everyone was going to with their computer related problems.
                    And I liked it.
                    So I gave it a little google search and why not start with some basic <b>HTML/CSS</b>. Even if I did
                    not pursue my learning path towards front end webdev it was a start.
                    Soon after I figured I might enjoy more the logical side of programming. And till this day I
                    enjoy Python and subsequently Java. And I hope to get the opportunity to learn
                    more <b>new languages, libraries, frameworks and to improve even more my logical skill set.</b></p>
